6-concat.py - a Python script that completes the source code provided to print Welcome to Holberton School!

7-edges.py - a Python script that completes the source code provided so as to split a string into parts with the following requirements in mind:
No use of loops or conditional statements
The program should be exactly 8 lines long
word_first_3 should contain the first 3 letters of the variable word
word_last_2 should contain the last 2 letters of the variable word
middle_word should contain the value of the variable word without the first and last letters

8-concat_edges.py - a Python script that completes the source code provided, so as to print object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line, with the following conditions in place:
No use of loops or conditional statements
The program should be exactly 5 lines long
No creation of new variables
No use of string literals

9-easter_egg.py - a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by TimPeters, followed by a new line.
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

10-linked_lists.c, lists.h
Technical interview preparation:
A function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

100-write.py - a Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line. With the following conditions in place:
Using the function write from the sys module
No use of print
The script should print to stderr
The script should exit with the status code 1

101-compile - a script that compiles a Python script file.


102-magic_calculation.py -  Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:

  3           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (98)
              3 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
              6 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
              9 BINARY_POWER
             10 BINARY_ADD
             11 RETURN_VALUE
